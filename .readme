# Weather Information Code
 
 This repository contains two Python code snippets related to weather information.
 
 ## Season Finder
 
 The `season_finder.py` file contains a function `find_season(country, month)` that determines the season of the year based on the given country and month. It utilizes a predefined set of seasons for different countries. The function returns the corresponding season and can display a graphics symbol representing the season.
 
 To run the code:
 1. Open the `season_finder.py` file.
 2. Ensure the Python interpreter is installed on your system.
 3. Modify the code if necessary (e.g., add or modify country-season mappings).
 4. Run the file in a Python environment.
 5. Follow the prompts to enter the country and month.
 6. The program will display the season in text format and show a graphics symbol representing the season.
 
 ## Temperature Comparison
 
 The `temperature_comparison.py` file contains a function `compare_temperature(city, temperature, time)` that compares a given temperature reading with the average temperature of a city at a specific time (morning or evening). It uses predefined temperature data for different cities. The function determines whether the temperature is above or below the average and provides an appropriate message.
 
 To run the code:
 1. Open the `temperature_comparison.py` file.
 2. Ensure the Python interpreter is installed on your system.
 3. Modify the code if necessary (e.g., add or modify city-temperature mappings).
 4. Run the file in a Python environment.
 5. Follow the prompts to enter the city, temperature, and time (morning or evening).
 6. The program will compare the temperature with the average and display a message indicating whether it's above, below, or close to the average.
 
 Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
